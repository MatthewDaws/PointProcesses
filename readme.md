# Simple point process simulation in python


Some simple IPython notebooks showing how to simulate Poisson processes, Hawkes processes, and marked Hawkes processes (which can be used as a model for spatial self-exciting processes).

I notice that GitHub can now render `.ipynb` files natively, but for convenience, here are some links to nbviewer:

1. [Point processes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MatthewDaws/PointProcesses/blob/master/Point%20processes.ipynb)
2. [Temporal points processes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MatthewDaws/PointProcesses/blob/master/Temporal%20points%20processes.ipynb)
3. [Temporal spatial processes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MatthewDaws/PointProcesses/blob/master/Temporal%20spatial%20processes.ipynb)

Additional files:

- `utils.py` Some simple plotting functions, off-loaded to avoid cluttering the notebooks too much.
